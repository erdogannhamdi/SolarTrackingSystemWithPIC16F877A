Solar Tracking System With PIC16F877A
      
      The aim of our project is to provide servo motor control with PIC 16F877A using LDR light sensor.
      
      Thanks to the LDRs located on the right and left sides of the solar cell, it takes the light intensity in the analogue and converts it into a digital signal by ADC and displays the instant values with the help of the display. 
      When the value difference between the two LDRs is more than 7 or 7, the Servo Motor rotates the solar cell in the direction of light intensity. 
      If the value difference is less than 7, the motor stops. 
      
      Thus, the solar cell finds the ideal angle. 
      While the green LED is active when the servo motor starts, the red LED becomes active as soon as the motor stops. 
      The LED located on the solar cell is lit regardless of the power of the system. 
      The brightness of the LCD screen can be adjusted with the help of the potentiometer.
